      <h2>Sickness Absence Data Analysis</h2>
</p>
<p>This
research programme made use of routinely collected data on sickness
absence during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. By using this
data as a proxy for confirmed COVID-19 illness we were able to
explore the risks of COVID-19 amongst different staff groups. The
data also allowed us to explore the impact of the pandemic on
non-COVID-19 sickness absence (including mental health), and stratify
the risks for different demographic groups. The research programme
brought together experts from across the UK and involved
collaboration between academics and government bodies. 
</p>
<p>
  Healthcare
workers and other keyworkers (workers whose job was considered
essential to societal functioning) had a higher likelihood of testing
positive for COVID-19 than other workers during the first lockdown in
England. With approval by the NHS Health Research Authority, we were
allowed access to two pseudonymised databases prepared by the NHS
Electronic Staff Record (ESR) Central Team. They contained
information on demographic and occupational characteristics of all
staff continuously employed by NHS trusts in England from 01 January
2019 to 31 July 2020, and on all their absences from work during that
period, other than for annual leave – data from nearly one million
individuals.
</p>
<h4>Main findings / Outputs:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Between
	March and July 2020, the overall risk of COVID-19 sickness absence
	in National Health Service staff in England was lower at older ages,
	higher in non-white staff and (in comparison with administrative and
	clerical staff) more than doubled in registered nurses and among
	workers such as healthcare assistants providing support to health
	professionals. The risk in healthcare scientists was little
	different from that in administrative and clerical occupations.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p> In
	comparison with White ethnic groups, the risk of short-duration
	COVID-19 sickness absence was modestly elevated in South Asian but
	not Black groups. However, all Black and ethnic minority groups were
	at higher risk of prolonged COVID-19 sickness absence. Odds ratios
	(ORs) relative to White ethnicity were more than doubled in South
	Asian groups (Indian OR 2.49, 95% confidence interval (CI)
	2.36–2.63; Pakistani OR 2.38, 2.15–2.64; Bangladeshi OR 2.38,
	1.98–2.86), while that for Black African ethnicity was 1.82
	(1.71–1.93).

    </p>
    <p>After exclusion of episodes directly
related to COVID-19, the overall incidence of sickness absence during
the initial 10 weeks of the pandemic (March–May 2020) was more than
20% lower than in corresponding weeks of 2019. Trends for specific
categories of illness varied substantially, with a fall by 24% for
cancer, but an increase for mental illness.

      Over
	the study period, 164 202 new sickness absence episodes for mental
	ill health were recorded in 12.5% (119 525) of the study sample.
	There was a spike of sickness absence for mental ill health in
	March–April 2020 (899 730 days lost) compared with
	519 807 days in March–April 2019; the surge was driven by an
	increase in new episodes of long-term absence and had diminished by
	May/June 2020. The increase was greatest in those aged &gt;60 years
	(227%) and among employees of Asian and Black ethnic origin
	(109%–136%). Among doctors and dentists, the number of days absent
	declined by 12.7%. The biggest increase was in London (122%) and the
	smallest in the East Midlands (43.7%); the variation between regions
	reflected the rates of COVID-19 sickness absence during the same
	period.<a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/11/e054533">Impact
