<p>
Being the second deadliest infectious disease worldwide, Tuberculosis (TB) is a global public 
health concern. Portugal, a medium-low level endemic country, has one of the highest 
European Union Tuberculosis incidence rates. Although the incidence of Tubuerculosis in 
Portugal has shown a recent declining trend, the heterogeneity in both regional endemics 
and their evolution through time suggests that a deeper understanding of the 
spatiotemporal pattern of cases is needed. We are using information from the National 
Tuberculosis Surveillance System – General Directorate of Health - Ministry of Health 
(notified cases of PTB, annually), based on an agreement with the National School of Public 
Health, University Nova of Lisbon.
</p>
 
<p>
Our research in this area concentrates on two main objectives: 
<ul>
<li>Spatiotemporal modelling of success of treatment outcome, considering individual 
characteristics (socio-demographics, risk factors and associated pathologies) and 
ecological characteristics (environmental and contextual characteristics)
</li>
<li>
Spatiotemporal survival analyses focussing on delay to diagnosis (time between 
symptoms and diagnosis), adjusting for individual characteristics (socio-
demographics, risk factors and associated pathologies) and ecological characteristics 
(environmental and contextual characteristics)

<p>
Snakebite is one of the most important neglected tropical diseases in
the world largely affecting rural communities living in tropical and
subtropical countries. Sri Lanka has one of the highest incidence
rates for snakebite - according to hospital statistics about 37,000
patients are admitted to government hospitals due to snakebites
annually and hospital admissions are considerably varying among the
climatic zones of Sri Lanka.
</p>

<p>
This project involves modelling snakebite events based on
socio-demographic and geo-spatial predictors to develop a risk map.
CHICAS is collaborating with Faculty of Medicine, University of
Kelaniya, Sri Lanka in this project.

<p>
Partial likelihood methods  allow spatio-temporal models to be fitted
to point data without the need for computationally demanding Monte Carlo
methods. They can be applied to any model that specifies the intensity of
future  events conditional on the pattern of past events. This occurs 
naturally in such diverse areas as infectious disease models or patterns 
of birds choosing nest locations on a finite habitat.

<p>
The noisy knees project is about developing a device which uses
acoustic emission as noninvasive biomarker to detect and to
differentiate between different levels of severity of knee
osteoarthritis. This would allow easier, cheaper and more refined
diagnosis than currently used MRI scans. The idea is that if it can
pick up small changes in the knee joint, it can also be used in the
dynamic assessment during clinical trials and in stratified medicine.
</p>

<p>
The project involves Chicas staff working with colleagues from across
the faculty, as well as industrial partners involved in product
testing and development aiming to bring the technology to
market. The <a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/shm/research/projects/noisy-knees/">Noisy

---
<p>
Meningitis is a major health problem across a wide swath of Africa, the so-called "Meningitis Belt".
Within this belt, intense localised outbreaks of meningitis can occur. The current vaccination 
strategy is reactive, treating areas when prevalence hits a threshold. We aim to produce a 
predictive model that could direct vaccination schemes to areas of high epidemic probability.
Our method uses dynamic regression models in space and time to produce predictions of the
meningitis rate.
</p>
<p>
There is also concern that climate change is causing the belt to spread, affecting new
populations across Africa.

<p>
CHICAS is working with colleagues in Malawi to develop a monitoring &
evaluation tool, which will be applied to assess the progressive
impact, over time and geographical space, of a five-year malaria control programme
covering the population living in the Majete Wildlife Reserve.
</p>

<p>
Researchers from Wageningen, Amsterdam, Malawi and Liverpool are
conducting the control programme, where interventions will consist
of early diagnosis and treatment, mass coverage of insecticide-treated
bed nets, house improvement and larval source management. Special
attention is being paid to community involvement, to ensure a lasting
and sustainable effect of the malaria control interventions through
the creation of malaria animators and community-based malaria action
teams.
</p>
 
 
<p>
The overall aim of the project is to achieve a reduction of 80% or more in malaria-associated
morbidity and  50% or more in malaria prevalence.

---
<p>
Our earlier work on Loa-loa modelling 
developed a model for the cumulative distribution function of
intensity of Loa Loa infection based on 
community-level
prevalence from rapid diagnostic tests. This allows us to estimate the proportion of the
community whose parasite counts exceed certain policy relevant
infection levels (for example 8,000 or 30,000 microfilariae/ml) which
correspond to high and very high risk of severe adverse events when
the individuals are treated with drugs used in the mass administration
programme to eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis.
</p>
<p>
In an extension of this project we will be updating our risk map 
by incorporating the latest data from both rapid diagnostic test
results and blood sample tests. The model also includes geographic
covariates that give a broad indication of habitat suitability for 
Loa-loa infection.

<p>
Renal disease can be asymptomatic for many years, but early detection
and treatment can slow the rate of progression towards renal
failure. Analysis of routinely collected biomarkers of kidney function
can assist early detection. Current UK guidelines use the estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as an overall measure of kidney
function and recommend that a patient who is losing kidney function at
a relative rate of at least 5% per year, as measured by their eGFR,
should be referred to a specialist treatment centre. In this study, we
consider use of dynamic linear modelling to obtain the predictive
distribution of the underlying rate of change in kidney function. Our
overall aim is to incorporate model-based predictions into a real-time
surveillance system that can alert general practitioners to the
possible need for the referral of their patient to a specialist
treatment centre.

<p>

Coronary heart disease (CHD) represents the biggest single cause of
death in the UK. CHD is currently the biggest contributor to
inequalities in premature deaths. These inequalities stem from
differences in CHD risk factors between socio-economic groups
(e.g. blood pressure, cholesterol). The differences in risk factors
are themselves the result of modifiable behaviours, primarily smoking
and nutrition.
</p>
<p>
The goals of the project are :
<ul>
  <li>Identify public health policies which could be used to improve CHD mortality and morbidity</li>
  <li>Assess the coverage of these policies across all socio-economic groups</li>
  <li>Determine the overall population-average effect and the gradient in the effect across socio-economic group</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Specifically, we have evaluations in various stages of development:
<ul>
  <li>Salt policies</li>
  <li>Trans fat policies</li>
  <li>Smoking policies</li>
</ul>

<p>
Campylobacter is the most common bacterial cause of reported 
gastrointestinal illness in England and Wales.  While food-borne 
transmission is a major cause of these infections, a large proportion
of cases have no known origin. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://enigmaproject.org.uk/">ENIGMA Project</a>, a Liverpool-led consortium 
aims 
to identify the key reservoirs, environmental and social drivers of 
Campylobacter that affect human disease; analyse seasonal variations 
in pathogen load and their impacts on exposure and disease; understand
the relative roles of the transmission pathways and thus points of control;
and generate future projections of disease risk and its control.  
</p>
<p>
For its part in the project, Lancaster are developing more sophisticated methodologies
for the integrated analysis of multiple datasets recorded at different spatio-temporal resolutions.

---

<p>
Alder Hey Children's Hospital's existing method for forecasting
admissions was based on admission counts in previous years - a bit
like trying to predict tomorrow's weather based on the weather a year
ago. We know it will be roughly right, but won't recognise that we
have "hot spells" or "cold spells" of weather away from the norm that
last a few days. Similarly, but for unknown reasons, admission numbers
show fluctuations away from the simple forecast model the hospital was
using.
</p>

<p>
We constructed a statistical forecasting system that uses the
historical data to get the average behaviour and modulates its
predictions based on recent data, producing forecasts that are more
accurate and have an associated measure of precision.
</p>

<p>
The daily predictions are delivered via an interactive web site
accessible to hospital staff only. You can view
the <a href="http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~rowlings/Chicas/AlderHey/">demo site</a>
which uses simulated data only.

<p>
Acute kidney injury (AKI) corresponds to sudden falls of kidney
excretion function in a short time. It is common and catastrophic
especially in hospitalised and critically-ill patients and has now
been accepted as an important public health problem. However, the
literature on the influence of AKI on proceeding kidney function is
vague. In this study, we study the influence of AKI on long-term
kidney function amongst patients who were identified as having chronic
kidney disease.
