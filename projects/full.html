<p>A number of CHICAS research staff and students are now devoting
much of their research efforts to COVID-19-related activity. Our
modelling activities are helping to advise and support pandemic
response and decision making in the UK and internationally. We
currently have representation on SPI-M (the modelling group advising
UK DHSC) and the WHO COVID-19 modelling group, as well as working with
regional NHS and public health groups.</p>

<h4>Early Outbreak Modelling</h4>
<p>Jon Read, Jessica Bridgen, Chris Jewell and colleagues from the Universities of Florida and Glasgow
  produced <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v1.full.pdf">a paper</a> based on the early data from Wuhan. 
</p>


<h4>International Case/Death Dashboard</h4>
<p>Max Eyre has built <a href="https://maxeyre.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/">a web application</a> for plotting case counts and other time-series data from <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">Johns Hopkins CSSE</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public">Public Health England</a>.</p>


<h4>UK/World Map Dashboard</h4>
<p>Simon Alderton has produced a <a href="http://www.geospatialmodelling.com/covid-19">web-based dashboard</a> for the analysis
of the latest UK (PHE) and international (JH) data collected
from the outbreak. Items include animated representations of
transmission at different spatial scales through time, and numbers of
  tests performed, and cases identified, in the UK.
  </p>

<h4>Real-time Epidemic Mapping</h4>
<p>
Peter Diggle and Claudio Fronterrè have been working with colleagues
at Swansea University for the Welsh government to map the epidemic in
near-real time using data-feeds from the Covid Symptom Reporting App,
and with colleagues imperial College to conduct geospatial analyses of
the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.30.20239806v1">REACT</a> series
of randomised Covid prevalence surveys.
</p>

<h4>Care Homes during COVID</h4>
<p>
The coronavirus pandemic hit care homes hard - leading to a doubling
of deaths among residents during the April 2020 peak of the pandemic.
Now a team of researchers led by Lancaster University, including data
scientists and clinicians, aim to gain a clearer picture of how
COVID-19 patients were managed in UK care homes as the pandemic
unfolded.  Their research will offer insights into how different homes
dealt with the crisis and provide valuable information to help guide
Government, care home managers and staff in future crises.

<p>

  Chronic respiratory disease (CRD) remains a leading cause of
  morbidity and mortality in the UK, representing a large burden on
  the NHS. CRD has strong links with deprivation and health
  inequalities; this is particularly relevant in the Morecambe Bay
  Area, which contains some of the most deprived communities in the
  country.
</p>
<p>
The Morecambe Bay Respiratory Network (MBRN) is the emerging
integrated care initiative in the local area which aims to improve the
quality and efficiency of respiratory services to provide the best
possible care for patients. The MBRN is based around a significantly
upskilled primary care service, closely supported by secondary care
expertise via monthly multi-disciplinary team meetings.
</p>
<p>
This project is at the interface of statistical methodology and
applications in the health sciences. Through close contact with key
clinical figures in respiratory disease, the results will provide
answers to questions of local relevance to the NHS and will be used to
guide the future development and implementation of the MBRN.
</p>
<p>
The research utilises a large body of medical data from the Morecambe Bay community data warehouse to achieve the following key aims: 
<ul>
<li>    Understand patterns in health care service utilisation via spatio-temporal models </li>
<li>    Develop classifi­cation algorithms to understand the features of diagnostic quality for the four most prevalent CRDs (COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis, and ILD) </li>
<li>    Develop models to predict the effect of individual care pathways on symptom control and patient outcome following diagnosis </li>

<p>
Much remains unknown about how antibiotic resistance spreads globally,
which is particularly true in sub-Saharan Africa, where diagnostic
laboratories are not commonly available. DRUM will work
collaboratively within Uganda and Malawi to identify and understand
the key drivers of resistance.
</p><p>
The DRUM Consortium will address how human behaviour and antibacterial
usage in the home, around animals, and in the wider environment in
urban and rural areas of Uganda and Malawi contributes to the spread
of antibiotic resistance in bacteria.
</p><p>

DRUM seeks to develop agent-based models that will enable the
prediction of how these transmission pathways can be
interrupted. DRUM’s vision is to establish Ugandan and Malawian sites
as sustainable model settings for interdisciplinary study and
mitigation of AMR by embedding a One Health strategy at the heart of a
consortium that will generate outputs applicable to similar
communities throughout East and Southern Africa and beyond.
</p><p>
The DRUM Consortium consists of researchers from:
<ul>
<li>African Institute for Development Policy</li>
<li>Centre for Ecology and Hydrology</li>
 <li>Institute of Infectious Diseases (IDI)</li>
 <li>Lancaster University</li>

<p>
The Dynamic Health Altas is a health informatics-based research
project. It is a web application which we have developed to
display point or areal data in space and time. This enables
visualisation of the health landscape of a population as it changes
over time. For example, such visualisations could be of particular
interest to healthcare managers wishing to implement or monitor
interventions at a population level. We have made this software open
source so that it can be applied to wide range of data.  Initially
this project used the Salford NHS records to create a health atlas to
show the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in Salford. It
dynamically displayed the past and present health landscape for this
disease in each sub-region of Salford.
</p>
<p>
The Dynamic Health Altas
is now being applied to:
<ul>
  <li><b>Hazardous Prescribing in Salford</b>: The
Salford Medication Safety Dashboard (SMASH) is a web application which
allows NHS GPs, pharmacists and healthcare managers to view patients
who may be at risk due to hazardous prescribing. The Dynamic Health
Atlas will be used to visualise (map) the prevalence of hazard
prescribing at NHS GP surgeries across Salford (UK) and track how it
evolves through time.</li>
  <li><b>Dengue in Sri Lanka</b>: The Dynamic Health Atlas is being used to visualise the prevalence of
Dengue cases in each district from 2011 to the present day. This work is currently being
extended to predict the prevalence of Dengue in each district for several months into the
    future.
  </li>
</ul>

This project is funded by the <a href="https://www.mrc.ac.uk/">Medical Research Council</a>

<p>
Literacy scores are associated with an individual’s employment and health outcomes, wealth creation, and with
societal crime rates and welfare dependency. Yet, even in developed countries, between one quarter to half of 9-
to 11-year-olds fail to reach age-appropriate levels of attainment. To reduce the attainment gap, we
require developmental models of literacy that account for the reciprocity and interdependence among different
skills across development, and trajectories of development.  
</p>
<p>
To advance understanding of early literacy development through analysis of children’s interactions with a
digital reading support we use dataset from
<a href="https://amplify.com/programs/amplify-reading">Amplify Reading</a>.
This evidence-based curriculum supplement has been adopted by over 2,000 schools in the USA, reaching
about 250,000 5- to 11-year-olds. Initial exploration of the data has highlighted clear statistical challenges in its
analysis as well as exciting opportunities related to multiple levels of both the temporal
granularity and the variation in user behaviours.
</p>
<p>
The project will advance the fields of psychology, statistics and education by testing theory-derived hypotheses
about specific relations among reading components, through novel statistical methodology. Thus informing the
development of effective curricula and intervention for beginner readers. 
This project is a part of large international collaboration of literacy researchers in the UK, Netherlands, Italy and
United States. The project is led jointly by CHICAS and the Department of Psychology in Lancaster.

In almost any geostatistical analysis, one of the underlying, often
implicit, modelling assumptions is that the spatial locations, where
measurements are taken, are recorded without error. In this project we
aim at developing geostatistical inference when this assumption is not
valid. This is often the case when, for example, individual address
information is randomly altered to provide privacy protection
(geomasking) or imprecisions are induced by geocoding processes and
measurement devices.

---
<p>
Neurologists in the UK are a limited resource and waiting lists for appointments in
outpatient neurology services are frequently long. There is therefore a need to investigate
how to improve the service in terms of both efficiency and patient experience – getting the
right care to the right people in the right timeframe.
</p>
<p>
Large amounts of data are collected during a patient’s journey through the healthcare
system, and although this is not collected expressly for the purpose of research it represents
a rich resource of information that can be harnessed to answer questions about patient care
and experience.
</p>
<p>
This project seeks to use routinely collected data to understand neurology outpatient
services, and to investigate ways in which they could be improved. Approaches include:
<ul>
<li>An analysis of waiting times and frequency of testing, follow-up and discharge from a
  consultant led service.</li>
<li>
A proposal of a methodology for identifying unexpected numbers of referrals for
headache from GP surgeries.
</li>
<li>An investigation into the use of State Sequence Analysis to identify common
  pathways though outpatient services and classify patient subgroups.

<p>
Together with Prof. Abdisalan Noor and Prof. Robert Snow from the
Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) in Nairobi, Kenya, we are
investigating the spatio-temporal trends of malaria in Africa over a
period of 100 years. The study is based on data from multiple
prevalence surveys conducted in malaria-endemic African countries from
1915 to 2014. The statistical analysis of the data presents many
challenges, such as variation in data-quality and temporal
sparsity. We are developing novel geostatistical methods that can make
the best possible use of the data whilst accounting for the main
sources of spatio-temporal variation.
</p>
<p>
The project is supported by an MRC Fellowship in Biostatistics awarded
to Emanuele Giorgi. One of the outputs of the project will be the
delivery of an interactive web-based animation showing the predicted
malaria prevalence, with other relevant summaries, across Africa.

<p>
  Immunotherapy helps the immune system (which protects the body
  against infection, illness and disease) to recognise and kill some
  types of cancer cells. We understand how immunotherapy works but
  very limited attention has been given to understanding the variable
  responses experienced by cancer patients receiving immunotherapy in
  the real-world setting. People with advanced cancer typically are
  helped by referral to palliative care services, with benefits seen
  in pain, symptoms and managing the stress of serious
  illness. However, those receiving immunotherapy may not be referred
  at the right time because of different expectations about a response
  to these new treatments. If we understand more about how these
  patients receiving immunotherapy respond or decline over time we
  will be able to target referrals better and improve communication
  about what patients can expect. This project, in collaboration with
  Christie NHS trust will investigate the drivers of differences in
  experiences of receiving cancer treatment, and will inform North
  West, and possibly national, cancer care.

The project is led by Division of Health Research in Lancaster Medical School with statistical support provided by CHICAS staff.

primary, underlying or contributing factor to cause of death. In
hospital, influenza poses a risk to both medical staff and patients;
it is one of the leading causes of respiratory infection and can be
fatal in the elderly. Vaccination remains the most effective method of
influenza prevention and control.
</p>
<p>
Medical communities and government commonly recommend seasonal
immunisation against influenza to reduce the occupational risk of
infection for HCWs and medical students. A suitable seasonal
vaccine is available and supplied to HCWs for free, and is highly
encouraged for anyone in the health care profession. Despite this only
54.8% all frontline HCWs choose to be immunised.
</p>
<p>
Social network analysis (SNA) has become an increasingly popular tool
in public health and epidemiological studies. Unlike some other
statistical approaches such as, Susceptible – Infected – Recovered
(SIR) models, SNA does not assume random mixing within a population,
rather that any population has a non-random structure and that this
influences interactions within it. Analysing network structures can be
highly informative, particularly when studying phenomena such as
transmission pathways for infectious diseases. SNA allows the
evaluation of an individual’s behaviour, taking into account the
influence of their spatial position within the social network.

network:

<p>
It has been shown that individuals who are connected within a social
network may influence each other’s behaviour, even when not connected
directly. In the context of vaccination behaviour, Brunson (2013)
found that social networks play a role in parents’ vaccination
decision-making for their children. For the majority of parents
studied, the people included in their social networks were more
influential than other sources of information, such as the media; the
percentage of people recommending non-conformity held the highest
predictive power of parents’ vaccination decision. If an individual’s
vaccination decision is affected by their immediate social circle,
clusters of unvaccinated individuals can develop –and these clusters
may then facilitate outbreaks of infection. It may be the case that
there are similar influences at work when HCWs are making a decision
as to whether or not to get vaccinated against seasonal
influenza. However, despite increased interest in improving
vaccination uptake in this sub-population, vaccine uptake in HCWs has
not been studied from a social network perspective.  Research in the
field of communications analysis has shown that network analysis has
the potential to identify the structure of information diffusion
within a social network and identify influential
individuals. Therefore, in the case of HCWs seasonal influenza
vaccination it may be possible to identify (and target) highly
influential individuals within a network, in order to diffuse
vaccination practices and improve uptake rates. It is hoped that
improving vaccination uptake in HCWs will reduce their own
occupational risk; that of their colleagues’; and improve the safety
of their at risk patients.

<p>
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important public health issue. Its prevalence is around 5% in the
UK and it is frequently comorbid with other common diseases (e.g. hypertension, diabetes). For CKD
patients the risk of complications (e.g. vascular calcification) increases with decreasing kidney
function. Early intervention can reduce the number of patients progressing to dialysis/transplant and
reduce the risk of severe complications. Ongoing research seeks to identify secondary
care patients at greatest risk of losing kidney function.
</p>
<p>
Using clinical data we are studying the progression of CKD in a secondary care clinical setting using
the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Standards Implementation Study (CRISIS) data collected at Salford
Royal NHS Foundation Trust (UK). The CRISIS dataset is a prospectively collected observational study
of outcomes in non-dialysis CKD patients, with over 3500 adult patients at
Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust since 2002, and followed up annually.
</p>
<p>
The primary aim of this research is to investigate the key factors that affect the hazard for the end-
points of interest: end-stage renal failure; acute cardiovascular event; death. Risk-factors under
consideration include laboratory-measured blood biomarkers and routinely available clinical and
socio-demographic variables. Progression towards end-stage renal failure is known to vary among
primary renal disease types. We therefore aim to identify the key factors that determine the rate of
loss of kidney function both between and within primary renal disease types.

This project is funded by the Medical Research Council and is a collaboration with Phil Kalra of the
Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust.

<p>
Renal disease can be asymptomatic for many years, but early detection
and treatment can slow the rate of progression towards renal
failure. Analysis of routinely collected biomarkers of kidney function
can assist early detection. Current UK guidelines use the estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as an overall measure of kidney
function and recommend that a patient who is losing kidney function at
a relative rate of at least 5% per year, as measured by their eGFR,
should be referred to a specialist treatment centre. In this study, we
consider use of dynamic linear modelling to obtain the predictive
distribution of the underlying rate of change in kidney function. Our
overall aim is to incorporate model-based predictions into a real-time
surveillance system that can alert general practitioners to the
possible need for the referral of their patient to a specialist
treatment centre.

CHICAS is working with colleagues in Malawi to develop a monitoring &
evaluation tool, which will be applied to assess the progressive
impact, over time and geographical space, of a five-year malaria control programme
covering the population living in the Majete Wildlife Reserve.
</p>

<p>
Researchers from Wageningen, Amsterdam, Malawi and Liverpool are
conducting the control programme, where interventions will consist
of early diagnosis and treatment, mass coverage of insecticide-treated
bed nets, house improvement and larval source management. Special
attention is being paid to community involvement, to ensure a lasting
and sustainable effect of the malaria control interventions through
the creation of malaria animators and community-based malaria action
teams.
</p>
 
 
<p>
The overall aim of the project is to achieve a reduction of 80% or more in malaria-associated
morbidity and  50% or more in malaria prevalence.

Mental illness is rising amongst children, young people and
adults. One in six school-aged children has a mental health problem,
and this is likely to have been made worse by the COVID-19
pandemic. Mental health services are struggling to meet this rising
demand for help, and patients must navigate a complex network of
services to receive care, which includes NHS, local
authorities and voluntary, community, faith, and social
enterprise groups. Long waiting times can lead to further decline in
mental health, affecting social outcomes and increasing the need for
urgent treatment. Working in partnership with Lancashire and South Cumbria
NHS Foundation Trust (LSCFT) we will map patients’ movements
through LSCFT services. We look at the capacity in different parts of
the system and patient flow between services, including close
investigation of inequalities in access and various
barriers. Working with people who design healthcare
services we will improve patient flow through the system and ensure
the mental health patients get the support they need. 
</p>

  The project is led by CHICAS staff in collaboration with a diverse group of researchers from Lancaster Medical School
  including PhD candidate student Hayley Lowther-Payne.

<p>
Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are at a crucial point in global
policy decision making. Huge investments and global efforts have
reduced the burden of these diseases in many of the poorest
populations of the world but continuing investment is required to
eliminate these diseases as public health problems and to continue
progress from elimination to eradication. Quantitative modelling and
analysis make important contributions to this endeavour. The
Gates-funded <a href="https://www.ntdmodelling.org">NTD Modelling Consortium</a>
is an international team of NTD modellers who are working to support
NTD policy in these areas for seven diseases:

<ul>
  <li>Gambian human African trypanosomiasis</li>
<li>Lymphatic filariasis</li>
<li>Onchocerciasis</li>
<li>Schistosomiasis</li>
<li>Soil-transmitted helminthiasis</li>
<li>Trachoma</li>
<li>Visceral leishmaniasis.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Within the consortium, CHICAS provides statistical expertise to
complement the mathematical modelling expertise of other consortium
members. Our current methodological focus is on the development and
application of geospatial statistical methods for the design and
analysis of prevalence surveys when the disease in question is at or
close to elimination. These include computationally and statistically
efficient methods for real-time health surveillance and optimal
combination of “hard” and ”soft” outcomes (eg prevalence surveys and
mobile technology usage).

<p>
Partial likelihood methods  allow spatio-temporal models to be fitted
to point data without the need for computationally demanding Monte Carlo
methods. They can be applied to any model that specifies the intensity of
future  events conditional on the pattern of past events. This occurs 
naturally in such diverse areas as infectious disease models or patterns 
of birds choosing nest locations on a finite habitat.
</p>

<p>
We are currently exploring ways to use partial likelihood methods to estimate important structural parameters of infectious disease outbreaks, for example a spatio-temporal extension of the reproduction number, R0.

The <a href="https://sites.manchester.ac.uk/covid19-national-project/">
PROTECT COVID-19 National Core Study</a> on transmission and
environment is a UK-wide research programme improving our
understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is
transmitted from person to person, and how this varies in different
settings and environments. This improved understanding will enable
more effective measures to stop transmission, saving lives and getting
society back towards ‘normal’
</p>
<p>
Using data from the Office for National Statistics, Dr Edge and
PROTECT colleagues wish to answer new questions about the drivers of
these occupational differences by examining viral load and vaccination
status. In addition, we will explore in more depth how occupational
differences vary by ethnic group and region. We also want to look at
whether observed differences in COVID-19 positivity across occupations
translate to differences in the prevalence and severity of long-COVID.

  <dt>Vaccination uptake in different occupational groups</dt>
  <dd>
    Using nationwide population-level data, we calculated the
    proportion of people who had received two doses of a COVID-19
    vaccine (assessed on 31 August 2021) by detailed occupational
    categories in adults aged 40-64 and estimated adjusted odds ratios
    to examine whether these differences were driven by occupation or
    other factors, such as education. We also examined whether
    vaccination rates differed by ability to work from home. Our study
    population included 14,298,147 adults 40-64. Vaccination rates
    differed markedly by occupation, being higher in administrative
    and secretarial occupations (90.8%); professional occupations
    (90.7%); and managers, directors and senior officials (90.6%); and
    lowest (83.1%) in people working in elementary occupations. We
    found substantial differences in vaccination rates looking at
    finer occupational groups even after adjusting for confounding
    factors, such as education. Vaccination rates were higher in
    occupations which can be done from home and lower in those which
    cannot. Many occupations with low vaccination rates also involved
    contact with the public or with vulnerable people.

<p>
Seasonal influenza viruses are easily spread between people and
constantly evolve into new forms against which there is limited
immunity. They circulate around the world, infecting a large number of
people every year, largely driven by seasonal effects and existing
patterns of immunity to previous strains.
</p><p>
Influenza infection forms a substantial burden on the world’s health
and economy, and can have severe health implications for individuals
in specific risk groups, such as the elderly, pregnant women, or those
who are immunocompromised or suffering from poor nutrition.

 </p><p>

Our work focusses on modelling the spread and persistence of seasonal
influenza subtypes and strains to address specific public health
needs. These include:
<ul>
<li>Forecasting the severity of forthcoming influenza seasons</li>
<li>Improving surveillance, through understanding the geographical and demographic drivers of strain emergence</li>
<li>How should multivalent influenza vaccines be tailored to best protect communities or populations?</li>
</ul>

 </p><p>

The project will combine a range of models considering different aspects of seasonal influenza evolution and persistence of strains. We will work towards developing large-scale representations of human connectivity, at both national and regional scales, incorporating connectivity patterns arising from travel and from social interaction patterns, such as age-assortative mixing.

 </p><p>

Using such models, we intend to simulate the spread and mutation of seasonal influenza subtypes to recreate phylogenetic relationships and investigate the demographic and connectivity information required to reproduce observed patterns.

</p>
<p>This
research programme made use of routinely collected data on sickness
absence during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. By using this
data as a proxy for confirmed COVID-19 illness we were able to
explore the risks of COVID-19 amongst different staff groups. The
data also allowed us to explore the impact of the pandemic on
non-COVID-19 sickness absence (including mental health), and stratify
the risks for different demographic groups. The research programme
brought together experts from across the UK and involved
collaboration between academics and government bodies. 
</p>
<p>
  Healthcare
workers and other keyworkers (workers whose job was considered
essential to societal functioning) had a higher likelihood of testing
positive for COVID-19 than other workers during the first lockdown in
England. With approval by the NHS Health Research Authority, we were
allowed access to two pseudonymised databases prepared by the NHS
Electronic Staff Record (ESR) Central Team. They contained
information on demographic and occupational characteristics of all
staff continuously employed by NHS trusts in England from 01 January
2019 to 31 July 2020, and on all their absences from work during that
period, other than for annual leave – data from nearly one million
individuals.
</p>
<h4>Main findings / Outputs:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Between
	March and July 2020, the overall risk of COVID-19 sickness absence
	in National Health Service staff in England was lower at older ages,
	higher in non-white staff and (in comparison with administrative and
	clerical staff) more than doubled in registered nurses and among
	workers such as healthcare assistants providing support to health
	professionals. The risk in healthcare scientists was little
	different from that in administrative and clerical occupations.

    <p> In
	comparison with White ethnic groups, the risk of short-duration
	COVID-19 sickness absence was modestly elevated in South Asian but
	not Black groups. However, all Black and ethnic minority groups were
	at higher risk of prolonged COVID-19 sickness absence. Odds ratios
	(ORs) relative to White ethnicity were more than doubled in South
	Asian groups (Indian OR 2.49, 95% confidence interval (CI)
	2.36–2.63; Pakistani OR 2.38, 2.15–2.64; Bangladeshi OR 2.38,

    </p>
    <p>After exclusion of episodes directly
related to COVID-19, the overall incidence of sickness absence during
the initial 10 weeks of the pandemic (March–May 2020) was more than
20% lower than in corresponding weeks of 2019. Trends for specific
categories of illness varied substantially, with a fall by 24% for
cancer, but an increase for mental illness.

<a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs387/en/">Vector-borne diseases</a> are a class of diseases in which infection is transmitted between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)" alt="Definition of host">hosts</a> by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)" alt="Definition of vector">vector</a> organism.  Examples rank highly among the world's most devastating diseases, for example malaria transmitted between humans by mosquitos, and African sleeping sickness transmitted between many species of mammalian hosts (including humans) by the tsetse fly vector.
</p>
<p>
This project is developing methodology for forecasting vector-borne diseases using stochastic dynamical models:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Statistical fitting algorithms for inference on dynamical disease models.</li>
<li>Data assimilation for including many sources of epidemiological and ecological data.</li>
<li>Spatial latent risk surfaces for vector-associated disease risk.</li>

than 150,000 samples and identified new genetic risk loci for elevated
blood pressure. They have also used gene expression data to provide
further evidence of the functional involvement of the genes.

<p>
Acute kidney injury (AKI) corresponds to sudden falls of kidney
excretion function in a short time. It is common and catastrophic
especially in hospitalised and critically-ill patients and has now
been accepted as an important public health problem. However, the
literature on the influence of AKI on proceeding kidney function is
vague. In this study, we study the influence of AKI on long-term
kidney function amongst patients who were identified as having chronic
kidney disease.

<p>
Alder Hey Children's Hospital's existing method for forecasting
admissions was based on admission counts in previous years - a bit
like trying to predict tomorrow's weather based on the weather a year
ago. We know it will be roughly right, but won't recognise that we
have "hot spells" or "cold spells" of weather away from the norm that
last a few days. Similarly, but for unknown reasons, admission numbers
show fluctuations away from the simple forecast model the hospital was
using.
</p>

<p>
We constructed a statistical forecasting system that uses the
historical data to get the average behaviour and modulates its
predictions based on recent data, producing forecasts that are more
accurate and have an associated measure of precision.
</p>

<p>
The daily predictions are delivered via an interactive web site
accessible to hospital staff only. You can view
the <a href="http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~rowlings/Chicas/AlderHey/">demo site</a>

funding development of statistical models of food distribution (including journey time and costs) 
along the Amazon river system. By combining geographical data on food distribution networks 
with real-time hydrological data and proxies of adaptive capacity in cities we aim to produce an 
early-warning system for urban vulnerability to food insecurity.

transmission is a major cause of these infections, a large proportion
of cases have no known origin. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://enigmaproject.org.uk/">ENIGMA Project</a>, a Liverpool-led consortium 
aims 
to identify the key reservoirs, environmental and social drivers of 
Campylobacter that affect human disease; analyse seasonal variations 
in pathogen load and their impacts on exposure and disease; understand
the relative roles of the transmission pathways and thus points of control;
and generate future projections of disease risk and its control.  
</p>
<p>
For its part in the project, Lancaster are developing more sophisticated methodologies
for the integrated analysis of multiple datasets recorded at different spatio-temporal resolutions.

<p>
Cystic Fibrosis is one of the most common genetic diseases in white
populations. Survival has hugely improved over the last 50 years but
these advances are not shared equally across the population. Although
incidence is independent of socio-economic status, outcomes are much
worse in individuals from poorer backgrounds. We are using routinely
collected data to identify when, in the life course of individuals with
Cystic Fibrosis, inequalities arise and therefore what policies can be
developed to prevent these.

<p>

Coronary heart disease (CHD) represents the biggest single cause of
death in the UK. CHD is currently the biggest contributor to
inequalities in premature deaths. These inequalities stem from
differences in CHD risk factors between socio-economic groups
(e.g. blood pressure, cholesterol). The differences in risk factors
are themselves the result of modifiable behaviours, primarily smoking
and nutrition.
</p>
<p>
The goals of the project are :
<ul>
  <li>Identify public health policies which could be used to improve CHD mortality and morbidity</li>
  <li>Assess the coverage of these policies across all socio-economic groups</li>
  <li>Determine the overall population-average effect and the gradient in the effect across socio-economic group</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Specifically, we have evaluations in various stages of development:
<ul>
  <li>Salt policies</li>
  <li>Trans fat policies</li>
  <li>Smoking policies</li>

<h3>Aims</h3>

<ul>
<li>To examine historical patterns of emergency COPD admissions and outcomes throughout the North West using geocoded HES data</li>

<li>To develop methods of visualising spatio-temporally referenced admissions data so as effectively to communicate uncertainty to clinicians at the point of care</li>

<li>To develop methods of data-linkage between primary and secondary care records and other relevant data sources, for example socio-demographic small-area indices, NHS prescribing patterns and weather station networks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p>
Spatial and spatio-temporal statistical methods will be used to enable
separation of signal from noise in the pattern of admissions. The team
has previous experience of using this approach in NHS settings,
including real-time gastroenteric surveillance, prescribing, and sales
of non-prescription medication. In addition we will explore ways of
presenting real-time updates of these methods for use in a clinical
emergency admissions setting.

<p>
Bayesian analysis for epidemics currently represents the gold standard for fitting dynamical models of disease processes to observed data.  The development of reversible jump MCMC technology over the past 15 years has provided the opportunity to use Bayesian model fitting during an epidemic to provide real-time forecasts of disease risk.  This is able to inform adaptive control decisions and enable authorities to contain and extinguish outbreaks quickly and efficiently.  For large outbreaks, such as the UK foot and mouth outbreak in 2001, the repeated likelihood calculations required in MCMC means that inference has traditionally been too slow to make predictions in real time.  This project is exploring cutting-edge general purpose GPU methods to accelerate the likelihood calculations to a point where real-time inference is a possibility, and forecasts can be made within an overnight timeframe.
</p>
<p>
This fledgling project aims to provide an accessible and fast framework for epidemic prediction by:
<ul>
<li>Providing a flexible computational framework for rapid development of rjMCMC algorithms for epidemics</li>
<li>Leveraging the latest in massively parallel low-latency GPU processing for likelihood calculations</li>
<li>Designing a multi-level software environment for data-curation, analysis, and visualisation</li>
</ul>

This project is being led by CHICAS staff, with a view to extending to an epidemics-community supported open source project.

<p>
In the last 15 years 260 million clinical cases of malaria have been
prevented in Sub Saharan Africa, overwhelmingly through the use of
insecticides that target the mosquito vector.  Insecticide resistance
is therefore a major threat to the sustained control of malaria. Whole
genome sequencing of malaria mosquitoes has the power to revolutionise
our understanding of the evolution of insecticide resistance; allowing
us to design new insecticides and to develop strategies that delay the
onset of resistance. However genomic technologies will only reach
their full potential with improved sampling design and when extensive
individual and population level metadata (collection location,
infection/ disease state etc) accompany each sequenced sample.
</p>
<p>
Within this project, CHICAS will support the development of spatially-
and temporally- explicit sampling frameworks for malaria vectors to
permit local-scale genetic tracking and prediction of (i) population
connectivity, (ii) temporal stability and (iii) insecticide
resistance.
</p>

This is a £500000 MRC-led Foundation Award, with support from BBSRC,

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common coloniser of the human
nasopharynx, particularly in young children and in resource-poor
populations. In 2008 it was estimated to be responsible for over
500,000 deaths in children aged 1–59 months. Developing countries,
mostly in Africa and Asia, carry the highest burden pneumococcal
disease incidence in children.
</p><p>
In 2011 Malawi introduced 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
(PCV13). The aim of the project is to analyse the variation in risk of
vaccine-type carriage with age, adjusted for child-specific baseline
characteristics, time since vaccination and calendar time of
measurement. Data used were collected through 4 cross-sectional
nasopharyngeal carriage surveys over a 16-month period in Blantyre,
Malawi, commencing June 2015.

This is a collaborative research project conducted with Todd Swarthout

<p>
During the 2012 and 2013 meningitis years, the CHICAS (Lancaster) team
conducted an empirical evaluation of statistical model-based
forecasting algorithms using weekly district-level incidence data from
Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Nigeria, Senegal and Togo. The team had
previously developed the statistical models by analysing an
exceptionally long and complete twenty-two year (1986 to 2007)
time-series of weekly district-level incidence in Niger.
</p>
<p>

We used the weekly numbers of new cases in each district and an
estimate of the population size of each district to help predict the
probability that each district would experience a 'meningitis alert'
(5 cases per 100,000), or an 'epidemic alert' (10 cases per 100,000)
either within the next few weeks or in the current meningitis
season. We used the technique of dynamic linear modelling to deliver
the required inferences; our research was shared via teleconferences
with the World Health Organisation on a weekly basis.

<p>
Spatially targeting malaria control interventions in areas of high
disease burden will become a more cost-effective and sustainable
approach for national programmes in the era of elimination. To achieve
this the geographical scale in which to implement control and identify
the most likely sources and routes of infection are
critical. Wind-assisted mosquito dispersal is an important, yet
currently undervalued, source of information to track the spread of
malaria and predict outbreaks.  We will develop and apply a model,
previously and successfully used to track the wind-borne spread of
Bluetongue virus by midges, to predict the spread of malaria in a
rural region of southern Malawi. The ‘spatial-temporal wind-outbreak
trajectory simulation’ (SWOTS) model developed by Luigi Sedda and
colleagues at Oxford, will use wind data, household infection status
and insect flight parameters to determine the most likely source and
route of infection during the rainy season. We will empirically
validate the output from SWOTS using a simple mark-recapture field
experiment to determine the influence of wind direction and speed on
vector movement.
</p>
<p>
This pilot project will determine the applicability of SWOTS as a risk assessment and disease
preparedness tool for malaria in rural Africa and lay the foundations to extend to other transmission
settings and vector-borne disease systems.

<p>
The noisy knees project is about developing a device which uses
acoustic emission as noninvasive biomarker to detect and to
differentiate between different levels of severity of knee
osteoarthritis. This would allow easier, cheaper and more refined
diagnosis than currently used MRI scans. The idea is that if it can
pick up small changes in the knee joint, it can also be used in the
dynamic assessment during clinical trials and in stratified medicine.
</p>

<p>
The project involves Chicas staff working with colleagues from across
the faculty, as well as industrial partners involved in product
testing and development aiming to bring the technology to
market. The <a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/shm/research/projects/noisy-knees/">Noisy

<p>
The dispersal of hematophagous arthropods is a key factor determining
the spread of the pathogens that they transmit. Traditional
capture-mark-recapture studies of dispersal require that the marking
technique has limited impact on the dispersal behaviour and survival
of the individual. Phlebotomine sandflies and Culicoides are therefore
challenging subjects, due to their small size, fragility and local
abundance.
</p>
<p>
An immunomarking technique was successfully used to quantify the dispersal of
Palaearctic Culicoides. By marking individuals with food-based proteins as they emerge or
move through the habitat prior to capture, the immunomarking technique can address
some of the limitations of capture-mark-recapture. The technique uses a sensitive ELISA
that requires non-specialist equipment.
</p>
<p>
We will validate an immunomarking technique developed for Culicoides to study
sand fly dispersal ecology. We will transfer the technique across vector groups
using colony-derived insects and field studies in Brazil targeting Lutzomyia vectors
of Leishmania.
</p>
<p>
We hypothesise that due to the similarities in the biology of Culicoides and sandflies, the
immunomarking technique can be adapted for use with the main South American
Lutzomyia vectors to quantify their dispersal behaviour. Standardisation of
immunomarking for sandflies will facilitate studies at different spatial scales and habitats to
examine flight behaviour, resting and breeding sites.

In this project we have worked on the questions that will improve our
knowledge and understanding of the natural history of stroke in the
state of Kelantan, Malaysia. We posed questions to
subjects from the population of interest to reflect our results across
the greater Kelantan population to develop a model of risk
factors for stroke, models of case-fatalities and survival to compare
the characteristics and outcomes of two main types of stroke,
i.e. ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke, and lastly to assess
the longitudinal change in functional health status using the Barthel
Index post-stroke.
</p>
<p>
The project has produced four draft papers, in which several modelling
data collection and data analysis strategies were applied to four
data-sets: one was provided by the hospitals, two were extracted by us
and the final one was based on personal interviews with stroke
survivors. The new knowledge stemming from the stroke modelling and
outcome assessment developed and analysed in this thesis could help
improve our understanding of stroke in Kelantan. In conclusion, our
data and the four draft papers written based on this PhD project have
added new stroke data and knowledge on the progression of stroke,
which is understated in the Malaysian and Asian population in general
and in Kelantan specifically.

Being the second deadliest infectious disease worldwide, Tuberculosis (TB) is a global public 
health concern. Portugal, a medium-low level endemic country, has one of the highest 
European Union Tuberculosis incidence rates. Although the incidence of Tubuerculosis in 
Portugal has shown a recent declining trend, the heterogeneity in both regional endemics 
and their evolution through time suggests that a deeper understanding of the 
spatiotemporal pattern of cases is needed. We are using information from the National 
Tuberculosis Surveillance System – General Directorate of Health - Ministry of Health 
(notified cases of PTB, annually), based on an agreement with the National School of Public 
Health, University Nova of Lisbon.
</p>

Our research in this area concentrates on two main objectives: 
<ul>
<li>Spatiotemporal modelling of success of treatment outcome, considering individual 
characteristics (socio-demographics, risk factors and associated pathologies) and 
ecological characteristics (environmental and contextual characteristics)
</li>
<li>
Spatiotemporal survival analyses focussing on delay to diagnosis (time between 
symptoms and diagnosis), adjusting for individual characteristics (socio-
demographics, risk factors and associated pathologies) and ecological characteristics 
(environmental and contextual characteristics)
