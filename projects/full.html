<p>
The treatment for lymphatic filariasis can cause dangerous side-effects if
the individual is also infected with the loa-loa parasite.
Surveying loaÂ­loa prevalence in remote
villages can be
expensive, but
by combining 
techniques we
can optimise
precision for a
given cost.

---

<p>
Alder Hey Children's Hospital's existing method for forecasting
admissions was based on admission counts in previous years - a bit
like trying to predict tomorrow's weather based on the weather a year
ago. We know it will be roughly right, but won't recognise that we
have "hot spells" or "cold spells" of weather away from the norm that
last a few days. Similarly, but for unknown reasons, admission numbers
show fluctuations away from the simple forecast model the hospital was
using.
</p>

<p>
We constructed a statistical forecasting system that uses the
historical data to get the average behaviour and modulates its
predictions based on recent data, producing forecasts that are more
accurate and have an associated measure of precision.
</p>

<p>
The daily predictions are delivered via an interactive web site
accessible to hospital staff only. You can view
the <a href="http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~rowlings/Chicas/AlderHey/">demo site</a>
which uses simulated data only.

---
<p>
Bluetongue is a viral disease of sheep and cattle that has spread across Europe into the UK
in recent years. The virus is spread by biting midges across animal populations.
</p>
<p>
This project, funded by the BBSRC, will investigate several aspects of the disease, including:
<ul>
<li>Computer simulation modelling of viral spread</li>
<li>Midge capture, with species and DNA typing across farms</li>
<li>Spatial analysis and mapping of midge capture data</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The project is being led by staff from the Liverpool Vet School, with Chicas
working on the spatial analysis part of the project.

<p>
Partial likelihood models for space-time point data model the ocurrence of
events conditional on the past events. This occurs naturally in such
diverse areas as infectious disease models or patterns of birds choosing
nest locations on 
a finite habitat.

<p>
Bovine tuberculosis is a major problem for UK cattle-farming, with
especially high prevalence
in the South-West of
England. Describing the
geographical patterning of
different genotypic strains
of the disease-causing
organism contributes to
our understanding of 
disease-causing
mechanisms.

<p>
Meningitis is a major health problem across a wide swath of Africa, the so-called "Meningitis Belt".
Within this belt, intense localised outbreaks of meningitis can occur. The current vaccination 
strategy is reactive, treating areas when prevalence hits a threshold. We aim to produce a 
predictive model that could direct vaccination schemes to areas of high epidemic probability.
Our method uses dynamic regression models in space and time to produce predictions of the
meningitis rate.
</p>
<p>
There is also concern that climate change is causing the belt to spread, affecting new
populations across Africa.

<p>
The Health e-Research Centre is a Manchester-led consortium whose
work is directed at improving public
health by innovative use of health-
service data. CHICAS works on the
development of statistical methods
for detecting unusual patterns in
space and/or time. A recent example
is the discovery of very large
geographical variations in the 
prescribing of methylphenidate for
the treatment of ADHD.
