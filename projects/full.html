<p>
Acute kidney injury (AKI) corresponds to sudden falls of kidney
excretion function in a short time. It is common and catastrophic
especially in hospitalised and critically-ill patients and has now
been accepted as an important public health problem. However, the
literature on the influence of AKI on proceeding kidney function is
vague. In this study, we study the influence of AKI on long-term
kidney function amongst patients who were identified as having chronic
kidney disease.

---

<p>
Alder Hey Children's Hospital's existing method for forecasting
admissions was based on admission counts in previous years - a bit
like trying to predict tomorrow's weather based on the weather a year
ago. We know it will be roughly right, but won't recognise that we
have "hot spells" or "cold spells" of weather away from the norm that
last a few days. Similarly, but for unknown reasons, admission numbers
show fluctuations away from the simple forecast model the hospital was
using.
</p>

<p>
We constructed a statistical forecasting system that uses the
historical data to get the average behaviour and modulates its
predictions based on recent data, producing forecasts that are more
accurate and have an associated measure of precision.
</p>

<p>
The daily predictions are delivered via an interactive web site
accessible to hospital staff only. You can view
the <a href="http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~rowlings/Chicas/AlderHey/">demo site</a>

<p>
Together with colleagues from the <a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lec/" title="Lancaster
Environment Centre">Lancaster Environment Centre</a> (LEC), we are working on a project to model the impacts
of droughts and flooding on vulnerability to food insecurity for city-dwellers living in the heart of 
the Amazon region. We are investigating how food price variability interacts with poverty and 
livelihood strategies to determine food security, including perceptions of access and levels of 
consumption.
</p>
<p>
A £300,000 <a href="http://www.esrc.ac.uk/">ESRC</a> fellowship awarded to
<a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lec/about-us/people/luke-parry">Luke Parry</a> of the LEC is 
funding development of statistical models of food distribution (including journey time and costs) 
along the Amazon river system. By combining geographical data on food distribution networks 
with real-time hydrological data and proxies of adaptive capacity in cities we aim to produce an 
early-warning system for urban vulnerability to food insecurity.

<p>
Campylobacter is the most common bacterial cause of reported 
gastrointestinal illness in England and Wales.  While food-borne 
transmission is a major cause of these infections, a large proportion
of cases have no known origin. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://enigmaproject.org.uk/">ENIGMA Project</a>, a Liverpool-led consortium 
aims 
to identify the key reservoirs, environmental and social drivers of 
Campylobacter that affect human disease; analyse seasonal variations 
in pathogen load and their impacts on exposure and disease; understand
the relative roles of the transmission pathways and thus points of control;
and generate future projections of disease risk and its control.  
</p>
<p>
For its part in the project, Lancaster are developing more sophisticated methodologies
for the integrated analysis of multiple datasets recorded at different spatio-temporal resolutions.

<p>

Coronary heart disease (CHD) represents the biggest single cause of
death in the UK. CHD is currently the biggest contributor to
inequalities in premature deaths. These inequalities stem from
differences in CHD risk factors between socio-economic groups
(e.g. blood pressure, cholesterol). The differences in risk factors
are themselves the result of modifiable behaviours, primarily smoking
and nutrition.
</p>
<p>
The goals of the project are :
<ul>
  <li>Identify public health policies which could be used to improve CHD mortality and morbidity</li>
  <li>Assess the coverage of these policies across all socio-economic groups</li>
  <li>Determine the overall population-average effect and the gradient in the effect across socio-economic group</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Specifically, we have evaluations in various stages of development:
<ul>
  <li>Salt policies</li>
  <li>Trans fat policies</li>
  <li>Smoking policies</li>
</ul>

<p>
Bayesian analysis for epidemics currently represents the gold standard for fitting dynamical models of disease processes to observed data.  The development of reversible jump MCMC technology over the past 15 years has provided the opportunity to use Bayesian model fitting during an epidemic to provide real-time forecasts of disease risk.  This is able to inform adaptive control decisions and enable authorities to contain and extinguish outbreaks quickly and efficiently.  For large outbreaks, such as the UK foot and mouth outbreak in 2001, the repeated likelihood calculations required in MCMC means that inference has traditionally been too slow to make predictions in real time.  This project is exploring cutting-edge general purpose GPU methods to accelerate the likelihood calculations to a point where real-time inference is a possibility, and forecasts can be made within an overnight timeframe.
</p>
<p>
This fledgling project aims to provide an accessible and fast framework for epidemic prediction by:
<ul>
<li>Providing a flexible computational framework for rapid development of rjMCMC algorithms for epidemics</li>
<li>Leveraging the latest in massively parallel low-latency GPU processing for likelihood calculations</li>
<li>Designing a multi-level software environment for data-curation, analysis, and visualisation</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This project is being led by CHICAS staff, with a view to extending to an epidemics-community supported open source project.

<h5 class="funder">This project is funded by the <a href="http://www.coltfoundation.org.uk/">Colt Foundation.</a></h5>

<p>
Influenza is an acute, contagious respiratory infection. Influenza
causes considerable mortality and morbidity each year and can be a
primary, underlying or contributing factor to cause of death. In
hospital, influenza poses a risk to both medical staff and patients;
it is one of the leading causes of respiratory infection and can be
fatal in the elderly. Vaccination remains the most effective method of
influenza prevention and control.
</p>
<p>
Medical communities and government commonly recommend seasonal
immunisation against influenza to reduce the occupational risk of
infection for HCWs and medical students. A suitable seasonal
vaccine is available and supplied to HCWs for free, and is highly
encouraged for anyone in the health care profession. Despite this only
54.8% all frontline HCWs choose to be immunised.
</p>
<p>
Social network analysis (SNA) has become an increasingly popular tool
in public health and epidemiological studies. Unlike some other
statistical approaches such as, Susceptible – Infected – Recovered
(SIR) models, SNA does not assume random mixing within a population,
rather that any population has a non-random structure and that this
influences interactions within it. Analysing network structures can be
highly informative, particularly when studying phenomena such as
transmission pathways for infectious diseases. SNA allows the
evaluation of an individual’s behaviour, taking into account the
influence of their spatial position within the social network.
</p>
<p>
The following animation shows a simulated spread of infection on a social
network:

<script src="spread/js/Rplot.js"></script>

<p>
It has been shown that individuals who are connected within a social
network may influence each other’s behaviour, even when not connected
directly. In the context of vaccination behaviour, Brunson (2013)
found that social networks play a role in parents’ vaccination
decision-making for their children. For the majority of parents
studied, the people included in their social networks were more
influential than other sources of information, such as the media; the
percentage of people recommending non-conformity held the highest
predictive power of parents’ vaccination decision. If an individual’s
vaccination decision is affected by their immediate social circle,
clusters of unvaccinated individuals can develop –and these clusters
may then facilitate outbreaks of infection. It may be the case that
there are similar influences at work when HCWs are making a decision
as to whether or not to get vaccinated against seasonal
influenza. However, despite increased interest in improving
vaccination uptake in this sub-population, vaccine uptake in HCWs has
not been studied from a social network perspective.  Research in the
field of communications analysis has shown that network analysis has
the potential to identify the structure of information diffusion
within a social network and identify influential
individuals. Therefore, in the case of HCWs seasonal influenza
vaccination it may be possible to identify (and target) highly
influential individuals within a network, in order to diffuse
vaccination practices and improve uptake rates. It is hoped that
improving vaccination uptake in HCWs will reduce their own
occupational risk; that of their colleagues’; and improve the safety
of their at risk patients.

---

<p>
Renal disease can be asymptomatic for many years, but early detection
and treatment can slow the rate of progression towards renal
failure. Analysis of routinely collected biomarkers of kidney function
can assist early detection. Current UK guidelines use the estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as an overall measure of kidney
function and recommend that a patient who is losing kidney function at
a relative rate of at least 5% per year, as measured by their eGFR,
should be referred to a specialist treatment centre. In this study, we
consider use of dynamic linear modelling to obtain the predictive
distribution of the underlying rate of change in kidney function. Our
overall aim is to incorporate model-based predictions into a real-time
surveillance system that can alert general practitioners to the
possible need for the referral of their patient to a specialist
treatment centre.

<p>
Our earlier work on Loa-loa modelling developed a predictive map to
identify areas of high Loa loa prevalence by combining prevalence
survey data with satellite-derived environmental covariates in a
geostatistical model for the spatial variation in prevalence.  More
recently, we have been modelling the relationship between
community-level prevalence and the distribution of intensity of
Loa Loa infection amongst infected members of the community. This
allows us to estimate the proportion of the community whose parasite
counts exceed certain policy-relevant infection levels (for example
8,000 or 30,000 microfilariae/ml), using only prevalence data. The
importance of this is that highly infected individuals are at risk of
severe adverse events when treated with drugs used in mass
administration programmes to control Onchocerciasis and Lymphatic
Filariasis, but estimation of infection levels on a wide geographical
scale is much more expensive and time-consuming than estimating
prevalence.

<p>
CHICAS is working with colleagues in Malawi to develop a monitoring &
evaluation tool, which will be applied to assess the progressive
impact, over time and geographical space, of a five-year malaria control programme
covering the population living in the Majete Wildlife Reserve.
</p>

<p>
Researchers from Wageningen, Amsterdam, Malawi and Liverpool are
conducting the control programme, where interventions will consist
of early diagnosis and treatment, mass coverage of insecticide-treated
bed nets, house improvement and larval source management. Special
attention is being paid to community involvement, to ensure a lasting
and sustainable effect of the malaria control interventions through
the creation of malaria animators and community-based malaria action
teams.
</p>
 
 
<p>
The overall aim of the project is to achieve a reduction of 80% or more in malaria-associated
morbidity and  50% or more in malaria prevalence.

<p>
The noisy knees project is about developing a device which uses
acoustic emission as noninvasive biomarker to detect and to
differentiate between different levels of severity of knee
osteoarthritis. This would allow easier, cheaper and more refined
diagnosis than currently used MRI scans. The idea is that if it can
pick up small changes in the knee joint, it can also be used in the
dynamic assessment during clinical trials and in stratified medicine.
</p>

<p>
The project involves Chicas staff working with colleagues from across
the faculty, as well as industrial partners involved in product
testing and development aiming to bring the technology to
market. The <a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/shm/research/projects/noisy-knees/">Noisy
Knees Project Page</a> has more information.

<p>
Partial likelihood methods  allow spatio-temporal models to be fitted
to point data without the need for computationally demanding Monte Carlo
methods. They can be applied to any model that specifies the intensity of
future  events conditional on the pattern of past events. This occurs 
naturally in such diverse areas as infectious disease models or patterns 
of birds choosing nest locations on a finite habitat.
</p>

<p>
We are currently exploring ways to use partial likelihood methods to estimate important structural parameters of infectious disease outbreaks, for example a spatio-temporal extension of the reproduction number, R0.

<p>
Snakebite is one of the most important neglected tropical diseases in
the world largely affecting rural communities living in tropical and
subtropical countries. Sri Lanka has one of the highest incidence
rates for snakebite - according to hospital statistics about 37,000
patients are admitted to government hospitals due to snakebites
annually and hospital admissions are considerably varying among the
climatic zones of Sri Lanka.
</p>

<p>
This project involves modelling snakebite events based on
socio-demographic and geo-spatial predictors to develop a risk map.
CHICAS is collaborating with Faculty of Medicine, University of
Kelaniya, Sri Lanka in this project.

<p>
In this project we have worked on the questions that will improve our
knowledge and understanding of the natural history of stroke in the
state of Kelantan, Malaysia. We posed questions to
subjects from the population of interest to reflect our results across
the greater Kelantan population to develop a model of risk
factors for stroke, models of case-fatalities and survival to compare
the characteristics and outcomes of two main types of stroke,
i.e. ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke, and lastly to assess
the longitudinal change in functional health status using the Barthel
Index post-stroke.
</p>
<p>
The project has produced four draft papers, in which several modelling
data collection and data analysis strategies were applied to four
data-sets: one was provided by the hospitals, two were extracted by us
and the final one was based on personal interviews with stroke
survivors. The new knowledge stemming from the stroke modelling and
outcome assessment developed and analysed in this thesis could help
improve our understanding of stroke in Kelantan. In conclusion, our
data and the four draft papers written based on this PhD project have
added new stroke data and knowledge on the progression of stroke,
which is understated in the Malaysian and Asian population in general
and in Kelantan specifically.

<p>
Being the second deadliest infectious disease worldwide, Tuberculosis (TB) is a global public 
health concern. Portugal, a medium-low level endemic country, has one of the highest 
European Union Tuberculosis incidence rates. Although the incidence of Tubuerculosis in 
Portugal has shown a recent declining trend, the heterogeneity in both regional endemics 
and their evolution through time suggests that a deeper understanding of the 
spatiotemporal pattern of cases is needed. We are using information from the National 
Tuberculosis Surveillance System – General Directorate of Health - Ministry of Health 
(notified cases of PTB, annually), based on an agreement with the National School of Public 
Health, University Nova of Lisbon.
</p>
 
<p>
Our research in this area concentrates on two main objectives: 
<ul>
<li>Spatiotemporal modelling of success of treatment outcome, considering individual 
characteristics (socio-demographics, risk factors and associated pathologies) and 
ecological characteristics (environmental and contextual characteristics)
</li>
<li>
Spatiotemporal survival analyses focussing on delay to diagnosis (time between 
symptoms and diagnosis), adjusting for individual characteristics (socio-
demographics, risk factors and associated pathologies) and ecological characteristics 
(environmental and contextual characteristics)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs387/en/">Vector-borne diseases</a> are a class of diseases in which infection is transmitted between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)" alt="Definition of host">hosts</a> by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)" alt="Definition of vector">vector</a> organism.  Examples rank highly among the world's most devastating diseases, for example malaria transmitted between humans by mosquitos, and African sleeping sickness transmitted between many species of mammalian hosts (including humans) by the tsetse fly vector.
</p>
<p>
This project is developing methodology for forecasting vector-borne diseases using stochastic dynamical models:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Statistical fitting algorithms for inference on dynamical disease models.</li>
<li>Data assimilation for including many sources of epidemiological and ecological data.</li>
<li>Spatial latent risk surfaces for vector-associated disease risk.</li>

Bovine tuberculosis is a major problem for UK cattle-farming, with
especially high prevalence
in the South-West of
England. Describing the
geographical patterning of
different genotypic strains
of the disease-causing
organism contributes to
our understanding of 
disease-causing
mechanisms.

During the 2012 and 2013 meningitis years, the CHICAS (Lancaster) team
conducted an empirical evaluation of statistical model-based
forecasting algorithms using weekly district-level incidence data from
Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Nigeria, Senegal and Togo. The team had
previously developed the statistical models by analysing an
exceptionally long and complete twenty-two year (1986 to 2007)
time-series of weekly district-level incidence in Niger.
</p>
<p>

We used the weekly numbers of new cases in each district and an
estimate of the population size of each district to help predict the
probability that each district would experience a 'meningitis alert'
(5 cases per 100,000), or an 'epidemic alert' (10 cases per 100,000)
either within the next few weeks or in the current meningitis
season. We used the technique of dynamic linear modelling to deliver
the required inferences; our research was shared via teleconferences
with the World Health Organisation on a weekly basis.
